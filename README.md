# Quick Fomplo Platform Documentation

Fomplo is one of my first projects i started since april 2021, it has been my great way of learning a lot about blockchain technology and Signum. I feel proud to share this with the Signum community.

### Services

The fomplo website consists of multiple centralized services in order to provide the best experience for the user. We will classify which centralized tools we use.

**Decentralized Tools**

- SignumJS (Signum `Javascript/Typescript` SDK)
- Remaining packages on `package.json`

**Centralized Tools**

- Cloudflare `DNS`
- Vercel `Website Hosting`
- Railway `Long Running Jobs Server Hosting`
- Upstash `Rate Limiting`
- DynamoDB `Database`
- ExchangeRate API `FIAT Rates`
- CryptoCompare API `Cryptocurrency Rates`

### Blockchain Usage

When the user is `Signing transactions` or `fetching personal on-chain data`, the website picks the node indicated by the [Signum XT Wallet](https://signum.network/wallet#XTWallet). This means the user has complete freedom to pick any signum node.

When `fetching non-personal data`, the website uses the `API Endpoints` for efficient queries
